What You're Aiming For

Your task is to create a basic webpage for a fictional restaurant menu. Use HTML to structure the content and include some common elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and links.

Here are the specifications for your restaurant menu webpage:

Create a webpage with a title that reflects the name of the restaurant (e.g., "Delicious Bites Menu").
Include a heading for each section of the menu: Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts.
Under each heading, list at least three items with their names and brief descriptions.
Use an unordered list for each section of the menu.
Add a link at the bottom of the page leading to a contact page (you don't need to create the contact page, just include a placeholder link).
